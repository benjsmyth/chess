# chessbot
An artificially intelligent chess player.

## Complete features
- Board environment (see `chessboard.py`, but be warned - it's a bit of a mess!)
    - Board display
    - Piece taking
    - Piece movement
        - Although I believe I covered nearly all cases of legal and illegal movements,
    there is quite likely something that I missed.
        - Consequently the AI may choose to make an illegal move that I never considered checking.
        - One significant bug is that the AI does not recognize a 2-Pawn opener as a legal move.
- AI environment (see `computer.py`)
    - Internal state
    - AB-minimax

## Incomplete features
- Promotion (not attempted)
- Castling (not attempted)
- Stalemate (not attempted)
- Check / Checkmate
    - I wrote quite a bit of code for this but in the end I did not wrap it up.
    - On each turn the program runs a test. It does this by examining the neighbourhood surrounding the opponent's King,
            and then inspecting the lines of fire of the attacking pieces.
     - This is actually a LOT more complicated than I realized ...
    - Since this functionality is incomplete, it may signal Check / Checkmate at the right or wrong times.
    - Consequently the game could possibly crash on ending, because I did not test this far enough.

## Evaluation method
- Simple weighted sum of (# of attacking pieces - # of opposing pieces).
- The weights are a maximum count of the # of spaces a piece can cover.
    - For example, a Rook can occupy 8 spaces in either direction, for a total of 16.
